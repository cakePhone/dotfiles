# Miguel's dotfiles repo

## Installation

To install everything, just do:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

It will install all needed packages for the scripts to work, nothing more.

You must be on Fedora for this to work. I'll probably adapt it to other distros if I ever use them.
